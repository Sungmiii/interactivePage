                    Damian White was one of four <span class="infotrigger">AOS</span> officers shot by Rhys Warren near
                    Kawerau three years
                    ago. He was
                    not only injured in the shooting but also deeply wounded by the criticism aimed at him and his
                    fellow officers by other cops, the public and Māori community. White's putting his hardman
                    reputation on the line to let others know it's okay to feel hurt and show it. National Correspondent
                    Carmen Parahi reports.

                    At every armed call out, Damian White carried a high powered rifle in his hands and a Glock pistol
                    strapped to one thigh.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Swathed in black from head to toe, he wore a ballistic vest to protect him from being stabbed,
                    slashed or shot at. Over the top was his equipment vest that held pepper spray, a baton, tear gas
                    and other distraction devices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During his AOS career, White confronted and arrested hundreds of armed offenders throughout the Bay
                    of Plenty. He sat, gun ready, for hours in the house next door to Jan Molenaar, the Napier gunman
                    who killed Senior Constable Len Snee. In the Solomon Islands, he helped contain village warfare, led
                    the recovery of an Australian cop who fell to his death in a cave and tracked killers through the
                    bush.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Remarkably, not once did he fire his gun. Not a single bullet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "There's been ample jobs I've been on where there would have been the right to shoot someone and
                    take a life," says White.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "But you don't want to, that's the last thing you want to do. No police officer wants to take a
                    life."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    White is a proud Māori cop of Te Arawa descent. A grandfather of one moko, with another grandchild
                    on the way. He has two adult children, a teenage stepson and young daughter who worry about his
                    safety. His wife is also concerned for him, about how the public and other police will react to her
                    husband's story.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    White spent 16 years in the blue uniform, 14 kitted in black AOS gear. He was based in the Bay of
                    Plenty, the land of his ancestors. He'd still be a cop now but three years ago, his life changed.

                    During the standoff between police and Warren, his whānau gathered at a cordon talking to the news
                    media accusing police of over-reacting because Warren was Māori.

                    <br>
                    White has shared ancestry with Warren, their grandmothers also played golf together. White's mum was
                    angry about other Māori playing the race card against her son.
